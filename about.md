I am a Prefinal year BTech student at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. I'm studying Mathematics and computing with a minor in Product Design.

In my freetime, I watch TV, documentaries or go cycling. And, recently I have discovered the beautiful world of opensource. This blog consists of my contributions ....and other musings!

Thanks for reading.
