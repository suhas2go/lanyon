In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

I am a Prefinal year BTech student at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. I'm studying Mathematics and computing with a minor in Product Design.

Mathematics and Computing is an offbeat degree in India, it consists of a mixture of Math, Computer Science and Finance courses. We share most of the Courses with Computer Science department on top of which we have our Mathematics courses. IIT Guwahati is a unique engineering institute as it has a Department of Design, I took up minor in Product Design because of my curiosity in the field of Design.



In my freetime, I watch TV series, go cycling or watch documentaries.
