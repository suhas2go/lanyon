http://suhas2go.github.io is now live! 

A simple blog built using jekyll and github pages. I'm using the beautiful lanyon theme by Mark Otto. I've tweaked the side bar to add my gravatar and font awesome icons.

### Lanyon by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo)

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
